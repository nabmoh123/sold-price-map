# Sold Price Map Frontend 

This project spins up a React front end showing a 100x100 Grid representing a property map. 

Each square on the map is coloured if there is an associated price to represent the price of the property in that cell.

I have omitted the testing from this project as I have demonstrated testing in the backend application.
